* I think it'd be good to get better statistics on accuracy by having a function perturb the coefs for the boundaries, get accuracy, supress plotting, and repeat like 1k times or something to get good error bounds and such
* When doing nc5 and nc10 for CurrNN with 0.5 noise, I got $0.0678, 0.0423$ respectivly. Tried to train the non CurrNN but i don't have the storage for it. Need access to UCF computer.
* It doesn't 'feel' like LSM is doing the same domains as we are since the plotting is so different but I might be crazy. Will need to confirm
